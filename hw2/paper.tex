\begin{abstract}
802.11 has included Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol, used to protect the 
link-layer communication from attacks. Several years ago critical 
security flaws were discovered, which compromises message transmission in WEP secured networks. 
In this paper we will discuss how WEP works, why it is broken, and how it the security issues
could have been avoided.

An introduction is in place




\section {Technical Description}
\label{sec:technical_description}

WEP uses a stream cipher called RC4 to protect the data transmitted over a wireless link. The seed for the stream cipher is 64 or 128 bits consisting of a 24bit initialization vector and a 40/104 bit key. The key is normally represented as a 10/26 character hex values.
